# wobot

A plugin-based HipChat bot written in Node.js.

# Installation

The easiest way to obtain Wobot is through [npm](http://npmjs.org/):

    npm install wobot

Keep in mind this module depends on `node-xmpp` which cannot be built without:

 - libexpat1-dev: `apt-get install libexpat1-dev`
 - libicu-dev: `apt-get install libicu-dev`

# Your First Bot

Instantiate the `wobot.Bot` class by passing it a hash containing:

  - `jid`: Jabber ID followed by `/bot`
  - `password`: The account's password
  - Optional `caps_ver`: Name and version of the bot. Defaults to `Wobot:x.x`.
  - Optional `debug`: When set to `true`, XMPP traffic will be printed.
  - Optional `host`: The hostname of the server. Defaults to `jid` host.

```javascript
var wobot = require('wobot');

var bot = new wobot.Bot({
  jid: '????_????@chat.hipchat.com/bot',
  password: '??????'
});

bot.connect();
```

# Events

The following events can be binded to:

## onConnect(callback)
Emitted whenever the bot connects to the server.

## onMessage(condition, callback)
Emitted whenever a message is sent to a channel the bot is in.

 - `condition` is either a RegExp or a string which must match the message for the callback to be triggered.
 - `callback` in the form of `function(channel, from, message[, matches])`.

`condition` can also be omitted i.e. `onMessage(callback)`.

## onPrivateMessage(condition, callback)
Emitted whenever a message is sent privately to the bot.

 - `condition` is either a RegExp or a string which must match the message for the callback to be triggered.
 - `callback` in the form of `function(from, message[, matches])`.

`condition` can also be omitted i.e. `onPrivateMessage(callback)`.

## onInvite(callback)
Emitted whenever invited to a room.

 - `callback` in the form of `function(roomJid, fromJid, reason)`.

## onPing(callback)
Emitted everytime the bot pings the server (roughly every 30 seconds.)

## onError(callback)
Emitted whenever an error occurs. `disconnect` will be emitted afterwards.

 - `callback` in the form of `function(message[, stanza])`
   - `message` is a string representation of the error.
   - `stanza` is an instance of `xmpp.Element`, when available.

## onDisconnect(callback)
Emitted whenever the bot disconnects from the server.

# Public API

Instances of `wobot.Bot` have the following methods:

## join(roomJid)
Join a channel.

 - `roomJid` is in the following format: `????_????@conf.hipchat.com`.

## part(roomJid)
Part a channel.

## message(targetJid, message)
Send a message to either a channel or a user.

 - `targetJid` is in the following format:

   - `????_????@conf.hipchat.com` for a channel message.

   - `stanza` is the full response stanza, an `xmpp.Element`.

Example return value for `roster`:

```json

  { name: 'The Bot', jid: '1111_12346@chat.hipchat.com' }
]
```

## getRooms(callback)

Fetches the rooms available to the bot user. This is equivalent to what
would show up in the HipChat lobby.

## sendIq(stanza, callback)

Sends an IQ stanza and stores a callback to be called when its response is received.

 - `stanza` is the `xmpp.Element` to send.
